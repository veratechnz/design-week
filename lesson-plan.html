The 4 Basic Principles:

 - Proximity 
 - Alignment
 - Repetition 
 - Contrast

<!-- Proximity: -->

"The principle of proximity states that there is a tendency to recognize stronger relationships between objects that are closely located together. In design, this means that similar design elements should be grouped and located close to each other. Groups of similar elements should be separated from others. Proper use of the proximity principle leads to less clutter and better overall organization throughout a site.""

"Proximity in design simply means that objects near each other are seen as a unit. It really is that simple and itâ€™s something you see every day. On your web page or your business card, related information is placed closely together and it forms a visual unit."
